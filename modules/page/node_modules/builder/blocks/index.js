// for some reason, if both blocks and templates are defined simply as
// `module.exports = {};`, it sees it as the same file and adds the blocks &
// templates to the same object... i guess this has something to do with the
// files being 100% identical aside from the filename...
//
// still, very weird. but because of this, we have to make sure the contents of
// these files are actually different from one another, that's why there is a
// more verbose variable declaration than would normally be required here
